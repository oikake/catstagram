// Exercise 2: Set It Up
// [x] Write a class component
// [x] Make it a div with a className of "HomePage"
// [x] Import "ImageUploaderForm" and "FeedList"
// [x] Include both components inside the "Homepage" div
// [x] "Export default" the "HomePage" component!

// Exercise 3: Prop It Up
// [x] Need to extract photos from data and then pass it into "FeedList"

// Exercise 5: Letâ€™s Get InFormation - BONUS
// [x] In order to get "Homepage" render the photo url you have uploaded to "ImageUploader" form,
//    you will need to create a function called "handleAddPhoto" that updates photos state by
//    accepting a url and creating a new object in photos state of the homepage component.
// [x] Then pass in that function as props to "ImageUploaderForm"
//    and when the user submits, call that function with the user submitted url.

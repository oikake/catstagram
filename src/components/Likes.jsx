// Exercise 2: Set It Up
// [] Write a class component
// [] Make it a div with a class name of "Likes"
// [] Write a span and a button element inside
// [] "Export default" the component!

// Exercise 3: Prop It Up
// [] Likes should take in number of likes as a prop and display it.

// Exercise 4: State It
// [] Create a button that toggles between two states: "Liked" and "Not liked (yet)"
// [] Add a constructor with initial state
// [] Add a button to the rendered JSX with an onClick attribute
// [] Add a method to handle the click/ change the state
// [] Hook up the button text to the state

// BONUS: Create a likes counter
// [] Take in a prop for the number of likes
// [] Increase or decrease the likes based on whether button click is like/ unlike
//    Hint: take the total likes as a prop, and convert it to state
